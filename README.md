# Stroke_Prediction
Brain Stroke prediction using Machine learning with visualization using python.

## Overview
Welcome to the Brain Stroke Prediction project! This repository contains a machine learning model that aims to predict the likelihood of an individual experiencing a brain stroke based on various health and demographic factors. Brain strokes, also known as cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), are a critical medical condition that requires prompt attention and treatment.

## How Brain Stroke occurs
A brain stroke occurs when there is a sudden interruption of blood supply to the brain, resulting in a lack of oxygen and nutrients to brain cells. This can lead to cell damage or death, causing various neurological complications.

**According to WHO  Stroke is 2nd Leading disease in the world.** So we must need to take seriously this.

# Project Overview
By leveraging the power of machine learning, we have developed a predictive model that analyzes several key features and generates a risk assessment for stroke occurrence.

## Data
The predictive model is trained on a well-curated dataset containing anonymized records of individuals, each represented by a set of attributes, including but not limited to:

* **`gender`**: The gender of the individual (e.g., Male or Female).
* **`age`**: The age of the individual in years.
* **`hypertension`**: Whether the individual has hypertension (0 for No, 1 for Yes).
* **`heart_disease`**: Whether the individual has heart disease (0 for No, 1 for Yes).
* **`ever_married`**: Whether the individual is ever married (Yes or No).
* **`work_type`**: The type of work the individual is engaged in (e.g., Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, etc.).
* **`Residence_type`**: Whether the individual lives in an Urban or Rural area.
* **`avg_glucose_level`**: The average glucose level in the individual's blood.
* **`bmi`**: The body mass index (BMI) of the individual.
* **`smoking_status`**: The smoking status of the individual (e.g., formerly smoked, never smoked, or currently smoking).
* **`stroke`**: The target variable indicating whether the individual experienced a stroke (0 for No, 1 for Yes).
